"""
given a string, tell if it is a panagram or not
"""

def det_panagram(s):

s = input()
print (det_panagram(s))

Each input argument should be separated by a new line.
1-D arrays need to be input in the following format:
length
element1
element2
... (and so on)

So an array such as [A, B] would be formatted like:
                                            2
                                            A
                                            B
